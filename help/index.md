# Help

There are a number of places where you can find help for issues with TeX and LaTeX. There is the **[documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/help/documentation/)**  distributed with LaTeX, several **[books]({{site.baseurl}}/help/books/)**, and **[links]({{site.baseurl}}/help/links/)**. The LaTeX Project does not have enough resources available to field questions directly.
