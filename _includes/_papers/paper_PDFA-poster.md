This poster shows an end-to-end workflow for truly accessible PDFs containing math and other complex material. It also discusses the general challenges when trying to produce accessible STEM documents and explains why the PDF/UA-1 standard (in contrast to the PDF/UA-2 standard) is not suitable for documents containing mathematics.
