<p>The LaTeX3 project is a long-term research project to develop the next version of the LaTeX typesetting system. In a <a href="/help/documentation/ltx3info.pdf">separate article</a> we provide a more detailed description of what we aim to achieve and how you can help us to achieve our goals. Some older reports on the work already done by the project are available from the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network (CTAN). Other work is available from this site as <a href="/publications/">articles</a> (in PDF format) and as <a href="/latex3/code/">development code</a>.</p>

<p>Until LaTeX3 is delivered, the <a href="/about/team/">project team</a> are committed to the active maintenance of <em>The New Standard LaTeX (LaTeX2e)</em>. The experience gained from the production and maintenance of The New Standard LaTeX will have a major influence on the design of LaTeX3.</p>
