# Pre-release 3 of LaTeX 2025-11-01 is available for testing

The final pre-release version for the 2025-11-01 LaTeX kernel went to CTAN few
days ago: it's now in TeX Live, and we hope people will test it out.

As with previous recent releases, the major focus here is tagging: we are
improving the code in various places, and moving from 'development' to
'production ready' status for tagging - at least if you are using a supported
subset of packages. Fixes continue, as always, with some low-level improvements
too (for example tidying up some parts of `\newcommand` 'under the hood').

For full details of all of the changes planned for 2025-11-01, see the draft <a

Enjoy --- Joseph
