# Pre-release 3 of LaTeX 2025-11-01 is available for testing

The final pre-release version for the 2025-11-01 LaTeX kernel went to CTAN few
days ago: it's now in TeX Live, and we hope people will test it out.

As with previous recent releases, the major focus here is tagging: we are
improving the code in various places, and moving from 'development' to
'production ready' status for tagging - at least if you are using a supported
subset of packages. 

Beyond tagging, we've taken the opportunity to address some long-standing
oddities in the kernel. In particular, `\newcommand` now avoids making `\long`
macros if there are no arguments to be collected. This one needs developers to
test it: please try out your files using `latex-dev`! There are as always a
collection of bug-fixes too: it is not impossible that these corrections affect
package code.

For full details of all of the changes planned for 2025-11-01, see the draft <a

Enjoy --- Joseph
